# Compilers : COMP36512

Going to be making my notes in this markdown file, plus also maybe throwing some basic implementations written in python for lexing, parsing, etc (if I'm feeling adventurous).

2. General Structure of a Compiler

## Lecture One: Introduction

A compiler takes some source code, and produces an output in another language, while the meaning of the source.

The compiler must:
 * Generate correct code.
 * Recognise errors.
 * Analyses and Synthesise.

The properties of a good compiler:
 * Generates correct code.
 * Generates fast code (optimisations).
 * Conforms to specifications of input language (standardisations).
 * Should be able to cope with arbitrary sized input (e.g: large number of variables, so forth).
 * Compilation time should scale linearly to the size of the source program.
 * Good diagnostics.
 * Consistent optimisations => similar logic in all instances.
 * Works with debugger.

Other issues:
 * Speed (of compiled code).
 * Space (we don't want our executable to be larger than the input).
 * Feedback.

Which issues do we prioritise? It is use case dependant.

## Lecture Two: General Structure of a Compiler

Two Major Phases: 
 * Front End: Analysis.
 * Back End: Synthesis.

Source -> (analysis) -> Compiler -> (Synthesis) -> Target.

The components of a compiler are outlined below:

Front End:

 1. Lexical Analysis (scanning): produces a set of tokens.
 2. Syntax Analysis (parsing): analyses the produced set of tokens and produces an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
 3. Semantic Analysis: annotates the AST.
 4. Intermediate Code Generation: 

Back End:

 5. IR Optimisation: 
 6. Code Generation: 
 7. Target Code Optimisation: 
 8. Target Code Generation:

##Â Lecture Three: Lexing

Lexing: reads characters and provides a sequence of tolkens.
